    <h4>Hello. I'm Julia. I am an aspiring UX Designer and entrepreneur.</h4>
    <p class = 'about-content'> I received my B.S. in Information with a concentration in User Experience Design and Information Analysis from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Currently, I am based in Bellevue, WA working with the Boeing Company in their Information Technology Career Foundations Program. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class='about-content'> Originally, I am from Auburn, Alabama, a little town in the south known for their football rivalry against Alabama. I am the eldest in my family, and I have two younger siblings who mean the world to me. By day I am a computer systems architect working to better one system interface at a time. By night I am a film critic sometimes and an aspiring chef-to-be. Through it all, I am always a southern gal at heart. </p>

  <p class='about-content'> One of my favorite things to do is make videos of places that I have been. This has been a recent development over the past few years. I think it's a great way to remember my experiences in a location and to look back on it in the future. Below are some videos I have made of places I have been. </p>
