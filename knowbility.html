    <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h3>
    <p>Austin Tenants Council is a nonprofit organization that aims to help Austin Tenants on issues regarding housing rights, but most importantly, ATC helps to resolve the problem of housing disrcimination within this vast city. A noble cause with high-quality service, however, when it comes to online services, ATC is certainly lacking. The original ATC website lacked predominantly in information organization and visual design. Thus, our task was to help recreate the ATC website in a way that gives them the modern appeal whilst maintaining the integrity of who they are and what they stand for.
    </p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Solution</h3>
    <p>To give this honorable organization the website they deserve, our team engaged in a design process of sketching, wireframing, and prototyping. Extreme ideas were presented, but the overall idea remained the same: the site needed to be more visual and humanized. The current website did a very thorough job of containing the information, but on an emotional level, it was a cold and distant site. Thus, our solution focused on making the site more visual and personable by incorporating more relevant images as well as including the voices and perspectives of those who have engaged with the services offered by ATC. 
    </p>
    <p> Below is the current result of the website; however, it is still a working progress.
